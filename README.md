# Spectral Diffusion

# See "ExampleRun.m" in the Example folder for step-by-step code.

# Overview
Code in Matlab 2023a for processing spectral diffusion of multi b-value DWI for multi-compartment diffusion MRI of the kidney. 
It takes a stack of dicoms sorted by b-value trace (nx, ny, bvalue), and approximates the inverse Laplace transform as a spectrum of M exponential components with non negative least squares. 
The regularization factor can be adjusted by hand, or can be set to generalized cross-validation.
The spectral peaks can then be sorted, with one example provided though the provided sorting may not be ideal depending on the application. 
It outputs maps and spectra on a voxel-by-voxel basis as matfiles.

# Code Base
This code was adapted by Mira M. Liu from a [simulation](https://github.com/JoaoPeriquito/NNLS_computation_of_renal_DWI) to create spectral maps with an image viewer that shows the spectrum per voxel. It also will sort parameters based on signal fraction and diffusion, and creates multi-compartment flow maps.

The multi-b-value decay curve is fit to an unconstrained sum of exponentials calculated with individual nonnegative least squares fit, i.e. an inverse Laplace transform of each signal decay. It based off of an original multi-exponential fitting model from Thorarin Bjarnason and Ross Mitchell (2010). 
Therefore, if you use any version of this code, please check out, and cite appropriately, ["Estimation of multicomponent flow in the kidney with multi-b-value spectral diffusion"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.30644) by Mira Liu et al., ["Continuous diffusion spectrum computation for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the kidney tubule system"](https://doi.org/10.21037/qims-20-1360) by Joao Periquito & Thomas Gladytz et al. as well as ["AnalyzeNNLS: Magnetic resonance multiexponential decay image analysis"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmr.2010.07.008) by Thorarin Bjarnason & Joseph Mitchel.

It is set to assume peak sorting into a maximum of three diffusion compartments, but this maximum can be adjusted on a user basis

The peaks are set to be sorted according to proposed kidney diffusion coefficient boundaries. They can be re-sorted as needed after the Spectral Diffusion is run. This can be done using the output spectral maps which is a volume  (nx, ny, M) of the probability distribution of diffusion coefficients for each (x,y) voxel.

The b-values must be updated according to acquisition, and the input file assumes it is images stacked in the format of (nx, ny, b) of Trace averages with b in ascending order (e.g. b=0, b100, b200... b800). See "StackedDicoms.m" for an example of the format.

The number of basis vectors is set to M=300, but the number and range can be adjusted. 

The regularization factor can be set to either be optimized for every voxel with generalized cross-validation, or to be set to a specific $\lambda$ value if SNR is relatively consistent.
