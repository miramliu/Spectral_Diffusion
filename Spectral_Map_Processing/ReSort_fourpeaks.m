%%  four part peaks, sort into blood, tubule, tissue, and remove peaks below 0.8
% Mira Liu Feb 29th 2025
% written originally by location along diffusion coefficient spectra
% now written to include largest peak as diffusion. 

% This code was written BRUTE FORCE and done as research progressed. It can certainly be neatened or re-written, and is provided just as a base example. 
% this is just one potential method of sorting the peaks, it showed statistical significance in kidney allografts but alternate
% sorting methods may be superior. This did outperform simple sorting by D thresholding, but again could be made much cleaner.

% 'expected' diffusion is 1.8, and assumes 'fibro' is discarded D < .8, tissue is 0.8< tissue < 5 , 5 < tubule <
% 50, < 50, and blood is > 50 (all in 10-3 mm2/s).
